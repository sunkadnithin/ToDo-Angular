# Angular Behavior Demo

## Description

This repository serves as a demonstration of Angular behavior. It showcases a simple to-do list application where users can add tasks with descriptions and delete them as needed. Additionally, it includes a feature to seamlessly switch between the home page and a help page without reloading the application, providing a smooth user experience.

## Features

- Add tasks with descriptions to a to-do list.
- Delete tasks from the to-do list.
- Seamless navigation between the home page and help page without reloading.

## Usage

1. Add a new task by entering a description in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
2. Delete a task by clicking the corresponding delete button next to the task.
3. Navigate between the home page and help page using the navigation links without experiencing page reloads.

## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed. Then, clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and run `npm ci` to install dependencies.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
